# osX-inspired-icons

Not my original work. I simply merged icons that i like from some of the most gorgeous icon sets - [macOS 11 iCons](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1220831/) and [MacOS sierra ct](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1210856/).

If you like the icon pack, go ahead and help the original authors.
